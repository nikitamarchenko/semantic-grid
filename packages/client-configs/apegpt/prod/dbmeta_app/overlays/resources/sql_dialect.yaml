    - Generated SQL has to be compatible with ClickHouse SQL dialect. 
    - |
      The following SQL statements are NOT supported, DO NOT USE:
      FULL OUTER JOIN, 
      RIGHT JOIN 
    
    - |
      Do not use LAG() or LEAD() functions. ClickHouse does not support them.
      Use alternatives such as groupArray() with arrayJoin() and indexing
      if you need to compare adjacent rows.
    
    - |
      The following functions ARE NOT supported, DO NOT USE: runningDifference, neighbor

    - |
      When using arrayMap in ClickHouse, ensure all arrays passed in have exactly
      the same length. If comparing adjacent timestamps, use arrayPopFront()
      with arrayPopBack() to create two arrays of equal size (length n - 1)

    - |
      Use arrayJoin() only on actual array columns.
      Do not use it on scalar columns like Date or String.
      If you’re joining two tables on a date, use JOIN instead of arrayJoin().

    - |
      Aggregate functions like avg() operate on scalar columns, not arrays.
      Do not pass groupArray(...) into avg(). Instead, use avg(column) directly.

    - |
      Do not pass arrays into dateDiff().
      It expects two scalar DateTime values. To compare arrays of timestamps,
      use arrayMap() with aligned arrays (via arrayPopFront / arrayPopBack).

    - |
      Use only ClickHouse-supported aggregate functions.
      For standard deviation, use ‘stddevPop’ or ‘stddevSamp’.
      For collecting arrays of values, use ‘groupArray’ instead of ‘GROUP_ARRAY’.

    - |
      Do not use subtraction between two DateTime64 values directly.
      Instead, use ClickHouse functions like dateDiff, toUnixTimestamp,
      or subtractSeconds to compute differences between timestamps.

    - |
      Only apply round(x, n) to numeric values like token amounts.
      Never apply round() to timestamp fields (e.g. ts), as it converts them
      to Float64 and breaks time functions like dateDiff().
      For comparing adjacent time differences, use groupArray(ts)
      combined with arrayPopFront and arrayPopBack, and pass them directly
      into dateDiff() without any transformation.

    - |
      Use HAVING only with aggregate expressions.
      Ensure all non-aggregated columns used in HAVING
      are either part of GROUP BY or aggregated.

    - |
      When writing a SELECT query with GROUP BY in ClickHouse, only include:
      - Columns that are in the GROUP BY clause,
      - Or columns wrapped in aggregate functions (like SUM, COUNT, groupArray, etc).
      - Do not include raw columns that are not grouped or aggregated.
        
    - |
      Ensure all columns in SELECT are either inside an aggregate function
      or listed in the GROUP BY clause. When using array functions like ‘length’,
      make sure the argument is actually an array.
        
    - |
      Important: ClickHouse does not support referencing columns from the outer query inside scalar subqueries.
      - BAD: `SELECT ... WHERE (SELECT max(ts) FROM table WHERE column = outer.column)`
      - GOOD: Use a JOIN or a CTE to bring in the required value from the subquery.

    - |
      Convert correlated subqueries into JOINs or pre-aggregated CTEs.
      Use explicit table aliases and avoid referencing outer query columns in scalar subqueries.
        Bad -- This will fail in ClickHouse!!!:
          SELECT *
          FROM transfers rt
          WHERE (SELECT max(ts) FROM account_token_balance WHERE owner_account = rt.sender_wallet)
        
        Good:
          WITH latest_ts AS (
          SELECT owner_account, max(ts) AS last_seen
          FROM account_token_balance
          GROUP BY owner_account
          )
          SELECT *
          FROM transfers rt
          JOIN latest_ts ON rt.sender_wallet = latest_ts.owner_account;
